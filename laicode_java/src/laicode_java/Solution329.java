//Number Of Negative Numbers In Sorted Matrix
//Given an matrix of integers, each row is sorted in ascending order from left to right, each column is also sorted in ascending order from top to bottom.
//
//Determine how many negative numbers in the matrix.
//Assumptions:
//The given matrix is not null.
//Examples:
//{ {-5, -3, 0, 0, 1},
//  {-3, -2, 1, 1, 3}
//  {-2, 0,  3, 5, 6} }
//The number of negative elements in the matrix is 5.
