//Sort With 3 Stacks
//Given one stack with integers, sort it with two additional stacks (total 3 stacks).
//
//After sorting the original stack should contain the sorted integers and from top to bottom the integers are sorted in ascending order.
//Assumptions:
//The given stack is not null.
//Requirements:
//No additional memory, time complexity = O(nlog(n)).
