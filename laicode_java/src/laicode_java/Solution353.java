//Max Sum Non-Adjacent Elements II
//Given an integer circular array (the last elements and the first element are considered adjacent), determine the maximum subsequence sum such that no elements in the subsequence are adjacent in the original array (It is possible that you do not pick any element from the array).
//
//Return the maximum sum.
//
//Assumptions:
//
//The given array is not null.
//Examples:
//
//{3, 0, -1, 2}, the largest sum is 3 (you can not pick both 2 and 3 since they are adjacent in the circular array)
//
//{-1, -2, -3}, the largest sum is 0 (not picking any element)
