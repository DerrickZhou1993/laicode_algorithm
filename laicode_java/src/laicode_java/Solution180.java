//Count and Say
//Given a sequence of number: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, бн
//
//The rule of generating the number in the sequence is as follow:
//
//1 is "one 1" so 11.
//
//11 is "two 1s" so 21.
//
//21 is "one 2 followed by one 1" so 1211.
//
//Find the nth number in this sequence.
//
//Assumptions:
//
//n starts from 1, the first number is "1", the second number is "11"
