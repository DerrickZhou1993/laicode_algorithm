//Largest Sum Of Valid Numbers
//Given a 2D array A[8][8] with all integer numbers if we take a number a[i][j], then we cannot take its 8 neighboring cells. How should we take the numbers to make their sum as large as possible.
//Assumptions
//  
//The given matrix is 8 * 8
//4 3 2 1 9 6 5 2
//5 8 7 6 7 4 3 1
//8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
//5 6 7 8 9 4 3 8
//8 7 6 5 3 4 8 9
//2 3 4 5 6 5 2 8
//6 5 8 9 5 4 2 3
//5 8 7 1 4 3 5 8
