//Sort With 2 Stacks
//Given an array that is initially stored in one stack, sort it with one additional stacks (total 2 stacks).
//After sorting the original stack should contain the sorted integers and from top to bottom the integers are sorted in ascending order.
//
//Assumptions:
//The given stack is not null.
//Requirements:
//No additional memory, time complexity = O(n ^ 2).
