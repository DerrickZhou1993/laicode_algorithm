//Depth Of Forest
//Given an integer array A representing a forest, such that, A[i] means the parent index of index i, if A[i] == -1, it means index i is a root.
//  Determine what is the depth of the forest, the depth of the forest is the maximum depth of the trees in the forest.
//  Examples:
//  A = {2, 2, -1, 5, 5, -1, 3}, represnts the forest:
//
//2
/// \
//0   1
//
//and
//5
///  \
//3    4
///
//6
//
//The depth of the forest is 3(the depth of the second tree).
//
//Assumptions:
//The given array is not null or empty, all the elements in the array are in the range of [-1, N - 1] where N is the length of the array.
//Corner Cases:
//
//You should be able to identify that there could be a cycle in the forest, what if that is the case? Return -1
