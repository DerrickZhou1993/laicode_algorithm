//Common Numbers Of Two Arrays II
//Find all numbers that appear in both of two unsorted arrays.
//
//Assumptions
//
//Both of the two arrays are not null.
//In any of the two arrays, there could be duplicate numbers.
//Examples
//
//A = {1, 2, 3, 2}, B = {3, 4, 2, 2, 2}, return [2, 2, 3] (there are both two 2s in A and B)
