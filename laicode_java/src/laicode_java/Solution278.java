//2 Difference In Sorted Array
//Given a sorted array A, find a pair (i, j) such that A[j] - A[i] is identical to a target number(i != j).
//If there does not exist such pair, return a zero length array.
//Assumptions:
//The given array is not null and has length of at least 2.
//Examples:
//A = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}, target = 2, return {0, 2} since A[2] - A[0] == 2.
//A = {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}, target = -2, return {2, 0} since A[0] - A[2] == 2.
