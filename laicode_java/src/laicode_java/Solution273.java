//Number Of Valid Triangles
//Given an unsorted array of positive integers. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as three sides of triangles.
//
//Assumptions:
//The given array is not null and has length of at least 3.
//Exmaples:
//array = {4, 6, 3, 7}, the output should be 3. There are three triangles possible {3, 4, 6}, {4, 6, 7} and {3, 6, 7}. Note that {3, 4, 7} is impossible.
//Preferred time complexity O(n ^ 2).
