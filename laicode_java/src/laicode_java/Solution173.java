//Compress String
//Given a string, replace adjacent, repeated characters with the character followed by the number of repeated occurrences. If the character does not has any adjacent, repeated occurrences, it is not changed.
//
//Assumptions
//
//The string is not null
//
//The characters used in the original string are guaranteed to be ‘a’ - ‘z’
//
//There are no adjacent repeated characters with length > 9
//
//Examples
//
//“abbcccdeee” → “ab2c3de3”
