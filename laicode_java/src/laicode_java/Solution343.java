//Number Of Pairs Diff To Target
//Given an integer array, determine how many pairs of elements, the absolute value of the difference between the two elements is the given target value.
//Assumptions:
//There could be elements with duplicate value in the array, and each of the elements is considered different.
//The given array is not null and has length >= 2.
//Examples:
//array = {3, 1, 2, 1}, target = 2, there are 2 pairs { (3, 1), (3, 1) }
