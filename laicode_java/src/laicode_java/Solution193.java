//Kth Smallest With Only 3, 5, 7 As Factors
//Find the Kth smallest number s such that s = 3 ^ x * 5 ^ y * 7 ^ z, x > 0 and y > 0 and z > 0, x, y, z are all integers.
//
//Assumptions
//K >= 1
//Examples
//the smallest is 3 * 5 * 7 = 105
//the 2nd smallest is 3 ^ 2 * 5 * 7 = 315
//the 3rd smallest is 3 * 5 ^ 2 * 7 = 525
//the 5th smallest is 3 ^ 3 * 5 * 7 = 945
