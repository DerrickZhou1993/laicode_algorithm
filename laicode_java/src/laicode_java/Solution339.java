//Largest Different Zero/One Numbers
//Given an integer array containing only 0 and 1. Find the subarray such that the absolute value of difference between number of 0s and number of 1s is the largest.
//
//Return the absolute difference.
//Assumptions:
//The given array is not null. It is guaranteed the elements are all 0 or 1.
//Examples:
//{1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0}, the largest difference is 3 (in subarray of {1, 1, 1, 0, 1}, there are 4 elements of 1 and 1 element of 0)
