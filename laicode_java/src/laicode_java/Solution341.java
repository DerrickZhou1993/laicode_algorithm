//Insertion Sort Linked List
//Given a singly-linked list, where each node contains an integer value, sort it in ascending order. The insertion sort algorithm should be used to solve this problem.
//
//Examples
//
//null, is sorted to null
//1 -> null, is sorted to 1 -> null
//1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, is sorted to 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null
//4 -> 2 -> 6 -> -3 -> 5 -> null, is sorted to -3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
