//Max Weights Sum Of Intervals
//Given a list of intervals, each interval has (start, end, weight). find a subset of the intervals, such that there is no overlap, and the sum of weight is maximized.
//
//Return the max weights sum.
//Assumptions:
//The given array of intervals is not null and has length of > 0
