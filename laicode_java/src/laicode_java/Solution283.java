/*String Distance
	Given an array of strings, and two different string s and t.We need to return the smallest indices difference between the two given strings.

	Return - 1 if we can not find s or t in the array.

	Assumptions:

The given array is not null, none of the strings in the array is null.
	s and t are different and they are not null.
	Examples :

	array = { "this", "is", "a", "is", "fox", "happy" }, the distance of "fox" and "is" is 1.*/
