//Minimum Swaps
//Given a string A (such as "abcd ef"), we want to make the minimum number of changes to convert A to another string B (such as "abcd fe"), noted that the size of A equals to the size of B.
//
//The allowed changes can be made are:
//
//swap adjacent characters A[i] and A[i+1], (0 <= i < size - 1)
//swap the first and the last characters A[0] and A[A.size() - 1]
//Your solution should return the minimum number of changes needed to convert A to B.
