//Determine The Type Of Last Byte
//Given a byte array, the encoding schema has the following rules:
//
//If the first bit of the byte is 1, it means the character is encoded by two consecutive bytes, the current one and the next one, it is a two byte character.
//
//If the first bit of the byte is 0, it means the character is encoded by one byte, the current one, it is a one byte character.
//
//Determine if the last byte of the array is the second byte of a two byte character or it is a one byte character.
//
//Requirement:
//
//You can only traverse the byte array from the last byte to the first byte.
