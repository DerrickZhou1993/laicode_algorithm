//Arrange Tasks
//Given a list of tasks, each task could have a list of dependency tasks, for examples, task 1 only can be executed after task 2 and task 3 finish execution.
//
//If at a time there is only one task can be executed. Find an order of finishing all the tasks. If there is no such order, return null.
//
//Examples:
//
//task 1 depends on task 2 and 3.
//
//task 2 depends on task 3.
//
//task 3 does not depend on anything.
//
//There exists an order [task 3, task 2, task 1] to finish all.
