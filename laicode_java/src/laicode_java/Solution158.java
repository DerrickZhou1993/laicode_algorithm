//Lowest Common Ancestor III
//Given two nodes in a binary tree, find their lowest common ancestor (the given two nodes are not guaranteed to be in the binary tree).
//
//Return null If any of the nodes is not in the tree.
//
//Assumptions
//
//There is no parent pointer for the nodes in the binary tree
//
//The given two nodes are not guaranteed to be in the binary tree
//
//Examples
//
//        5
//
//      /   \
//
//     9     12
//
//   /  \      \
//
//  2    3      14
//
//The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 14 is 5
//
//The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 9 is 9
//
//The lowest common ancestor of 2 and 8 is null (8 is not in the tree)
