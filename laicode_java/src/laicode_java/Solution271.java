//Smallest Non-Existed Subsequence Sum
//Given a sorted array of positive numbers in ascending order, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of elements of any sub-sequence of the input array.
//Assumptions:
//The given array is not null.
//Examples:
//array = {1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 15}, result is 2
//array = {1, 1, 1, 1}, result is 5
